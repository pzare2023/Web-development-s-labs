          <h2>My name is Parnia Zare</h2>
          <p>I was born on December 7th in Karaj, Iran. I’m 20 years old and currently living in Toronto, Canada. In 2018, I made a significant move to Canada, and since then, my life has been a blend of growth, adaptation, and ambition. Interestingly, I've moved 19 times in my life, which has shaped my resilience and adaptability.</p>
          <p>I am a 4th-year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University. My academic journey began in biology, but during my first year, I realized that my passion lay elsewhere, prompting me to switch majors. The decision to transition into computer science has opened a world of possibilities for me, fueling my curiosity in technology, programming, and innovation.</p>
  
          <p> This year, my primary focus is on maintaining a strong GPA while building meaningful networks that will guide my future career. I’m driven to explore different pathways in the tech world, aiming to find the one that aligns with my interests and aspirations post-graduation.</p>
